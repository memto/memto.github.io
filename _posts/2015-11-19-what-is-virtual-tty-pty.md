#### Switch between Virtual Terminals
```
[Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Fn] key. [Fn] stands for F1 to F12 keys.
```
The same thing can be achieved by using a little command in Linux called chvt.
```bash
$ chvt 7
```

And to return to the 1st virtual terminal, type:
```bash
$ chvt 1
```

Suppose you have Imagemagick installed on your Linux machine and you wish to take a screenshot of your GUI while you are logged in at the console. Here is a simple way of doing it:
```bash
$ chvt 7; sleep 2; import -display :0.0 -window root screenshot-output.png; chvt 1;
```    

What this does is, it first moves to virtual terminal 7, sleeps for 2 seconds, then use the import command to capture the screenshot of the desktop and save it in the file screenshot-output.png, and finally return back to virtual terminal 1 which was your original console. Cool isnâ€™t it?
