Three main types of object file:

* A *relocation file*

* An *executable file*

* A *shared object file*

#### File format
Object files participate in program linking (building a program) and program execution (running a program).  For convenience and efficiency, the object file format provides parallel views of a fileâ€™s contents, reflecting the differing needs of these activities.
